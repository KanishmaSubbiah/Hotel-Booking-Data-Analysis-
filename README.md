                              **# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis**
 **Objective**
            The aim of this analysis is to explore hotel booking data to gain insights into reservation patterns, cancellation rates, and average daily rates (ADR) across different types of hotels. By understanding these aspects, stakeholders can make informed decisions to improve services and maximize occupancy.

**Business Problem**
                    In this dataset both City Hotels and Resort Hotels have faced increasing cancellation rates, resulting in decreased revenue and inefficient room usage. The primary objective is to lower these cancellation rates to enhance revenue generation. This report delves into the factors influencing hotel booking cancellations and their effects on annual revenue.

**Assumptions for Analysis**
        •	No significant events occurred between 2015 and 2017 that impacted the dataset.
        •	The data is relevant for analyzing potential hotel strategies.
        •	Implementing the recommended solutions is not expected to produce unforeseen negative effects.
        •	The hotels have not yet adopted any of the suggested strategies.
        •	Booking cancellations are a major factor affecting revenue.
        •	Cancellations lead to vacant rooms during the reserved period.
        •	Customers cancel reservations within the same year they make them.

**Data Source**
          Dataset: The analysis utilizes a dataset named hotel_booking.csv, which contains various attributes related to hotel bookings, including customer details, reservation status, pricing information, and other relevant features.

**1. Initial Data Exploration** - This section involves an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and content. Key activities include:

           * Displaying Rows: The first and last few rows of the dataset are examined to get a quick overview of the data and understand the types of information included.
           * Checking Shape and Columns: The dimensions of the DataFrame are checked to determine how many rows and columns it contains, along with the specific column names.
           * Inspecting Data Types: An inspection of data types is conducted to identify which columns are numerical and which are categorical. This helps in planning subsequent analysis steps.
           * Summary Statistics: Summary statistics for numerical columns are generated, providing insights into the distribution, mean, median, and standard deviation. For categorical columns, counts of unique values are displayed.
           * Missing Values: A count of missing values in each column is determined to identify potential data quality issues that need to be addressed during the cleaning process.

**2. Data Cleaning**-  Data cleaning is crucial to ensure that the analysis is based on accurate and complete data. Key steps include:

           * Dropping Unnecessary Columns: Columns that do not contribute meaningful information to the analysis are removed, simplifying the dataset.
           * Removing Rows with Missing Values: Rows containing missing values are eliminated to ensure that the analysis is conducted on complete data, thereby improving the reliability of insights.
           * Handling Outliers: Outliers in specific columns, such as the number of children, babies, and ADR, are addressed to prevent skewed results. This involves setting thresholds to identify and remove extreme values.

**3. Data Analysis and Visualization** -In this section, various analyses are performed to uncover patterns in the data, complemented by visualizations for clearer communication of findings. Key analyses include:

             1) Reservation Cancellations: The total number of reservations is analyzed based on their cancellation status. This analysis provides a basis for understanding customer behavior regarding cancellations.
             2) Visualization of Reservation Status: Count plots are created to visually represent the distribution of reservation statuses across different hotel types. This helps stakeholders see trends at a glance.
             3) Comparing Average Daily Rates (ADR): The analysis focuses on comparing ADR for Resort and City hotels over time, revealing pricing trends and potential factors influencing them.
             4) Cancellation Rates by Hotel Type: The percentage of cancellations by hotel type is analyzed and visualized, helping to identify which types of hotels are more susceptible to cancellations.
             5) Top Countries with Canceled Reservations: A visual exploration of the top countries where cancellations occur is conducted, providing insights into geographical trends. 
             6) Room Type Pricing: The analysis investigates how different room types are priced and their corresponding ADR, contributing to understanding customer preferences and pricing strategies.

**Future Analysi** - To enhance the analysis further, several improvements can be considered:

           1) Additional Visualizations: Incorporating more advanced visualizations, such as heatmaps for correlation analysis and pair plots for multi-variable relationships, can provide deeper insights.
           2) Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests, like chi-squared tests for categorical data, could add rigor to the findings and help validate insights.

**Conclusion**
This analysis reveals significant insights into hotel booking patterns, including trends in reservations, cancellation rates, and average daily rates. By addressing identified areas for improvement, the analysis can be further refined, providing even more valuable insights for stakeholders in the hospitality industry.
